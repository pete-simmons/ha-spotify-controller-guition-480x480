# Spotify media controller for Guition 480x480 screen via ESPHome

Installable via ESPHome this code offers the ability to view what is currently playing through a Home Assistant Spotify media_player entity, and send basic controls back to Home Assistant.

Currently artwork is not displayed due to lack of support for JPG images in LVGL/ESPHome's online_image 

Update the substitution at the top of the YAML with your entity ID and you should be good to go.
